# regular-java-developer-test-app

It's the coding challenge that I took for 'Regular Java Developer' position.
This is a simple Spring-Boot REST API.

For GitHub I've changed some things, such as API endpoints, data objects, etc., but API responses and cases in which each of them is being returned are the same as in the requirements.
So some solutions may look a little odd to you, but so was the task.
